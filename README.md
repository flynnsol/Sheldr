## Why Sheldr?

While searching for CLI tools to use in a Ruby project I came across TTY (teletype) and was excited about how it functioned. Unfortunately, TTY hasn't been maintained for years and no longer was able to run when I tried to use it. I also noticed that it had some potential for updating and making things more fluid for an end user, so I started working on Sheldr.

## What does Sheldr do?

Sheldr allows you to quickly create new CLI applications while using the Sheldr CLI itself. Below you'll find more instructions on what those commands are and how to utilize them to create projects of different sizes and complexity.
